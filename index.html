        <h3>The Concept of Medical Tourism</h3>
        <p>
          It is a type of tourism in which a person goes to places famous for providing natural health care, such as hot springs, sulfur water baths, hot sand and mud, with the intention of treatment, relaxation and entertainment. Medical tourism is widespread in many countries of the world, and our Arab region is famous for its famous medical tourism destinations such as Jordan and Egypt, and some oases of the Maghreb, which have received the attention of Westerners since the mid-nineteenth century. Medical tourism was prescribed to treat mental illnesses, and with the advent of the twenty-first century, it turned into an industry, on which some countries depend mainly for their economy.
